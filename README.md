# Visualizing OPC UA Data on the Watson IoT platform
While modern information technology/IT systems use protocols like http, websockets, MQTT  (for IoT) and architectural styles (e.g. REST),   for operations technology/OT systems in manufacturing and plants a variety of other protocols are being used. In order to use this data a protocol conversion is needed. Fortunately OPC UA becomes a standard protocol and OPC UA servers can be used to collect that later can be consumed in OT (e.g. predictive maintenance) or combined OT/IT (worker assistants) e.g. uses cases .

Steps to visualize and consume the OPC UA data on the Watson IoT platform:

## Create an OPC UA Server 
* Create Ubuntu Device on the IBM Cloud
* security group opc ua, ssh, ...
* Install Ubuntu
* Install VPN Server
* Install VPN Viewer
* Download and install the Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server

## Create OPC UA Client (optional, for test purposes)

## Install Node-RED on the IBM Cloud

## Move OPC-UA data from the OPC-UA server to the Watson IoT platform using Node-RED

Optional: 
* Create Watson IoT Platform
* Create Device
